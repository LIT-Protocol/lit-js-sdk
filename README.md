## Publishing

To publish, use ./publish.sh and select "patch" for your version bump. You must have the "documentation" package installed globally on NPM which you can do with `npm install -g documentation`. You must also have the "jq" program installed, which you can install on mac with `brew install jq`. Only members of the Lit Protocol team can publish to NPM.
