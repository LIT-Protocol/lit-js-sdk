## Welcome

Welcome to the LIT JS SDK API documentation.  To understand how these functions fit together, please view the documentation for this SDK, located at [https://developer.litprotocol.com/docs/SDK/intro][139]

## LitNodeClient

A LIT node client.  Connects directly to the LIT nodes to store and retrieve encryption keys and signing requests.  Only holders of an NFT that corresponds with a LIT may store and retrieve the keys.

### Parameters

*   `config` **[Object][140]** 

    *   `config.alertWhenUnauthorized` **[boolean][141]** Whether or not to show a JS alert() when a user tries to unlock a LIT but is unauthorized.  An exception will also be thrown regardless of this option. (optional, default `true`)
    *   `config.minNodeCount` **[number][142]** The minimum number of nodes that must be connected for the LitNodeClient to be ready to use. (optional, default `6`)
    *   `config.debug` **[boolean][141]** Whether or not to show debug messages. (optional, default `true`)

### executeJs

Execute JS on the nodes and combine and return any resulting signatures

#### Parameters

*   `params` **[Object][140]** 

    *   `params.code` **[string][143]** JS code to run on the nodes
    *   `params.ipfsId` **[string][143]** The IPFS ID of some JS code to run on the nodes
    *   `params.authSig` **[AuthSig][144]** the authSig to use to authorize the user with the nodes
    *   `params.jsParams` **[Object][140]** An object that contains params to expose to the Lit Action.  These will be injected to the JS runtime before your code runs, so you can use any of these as normal variables in your Lit Action. (optional, default `{}`)
    *   `params.debug` **[Boolean][141]** A boolean that defines if debug info will be returned or not.
    *   `params.sessionSigs`  
    *   `params.authMethods`   (optional, default `[]`)

Returns **[Object][140]** An object containing the resulting signatures.  Each signature comes with the public key and the data signed.

### signSessionKey

Sign a session key using a PKP

#### Parameters

*   `params` **[Object][140]** 

    *   `params.sessionKey` **[string][143]** The session key to sign
    *   `params.authMethods` **[Array][145]<[Object][140]>** The auth methods to try for authenticating with the PKP.  You must pass either at least 1 AuthMethod or an authSig
    *   `params.pkpPublicKey` **[Object][140]** The PKP public key to use for signing
    *   `params.authSig` **[AuthSig][144]** The authSig to use try for authenticating with the PKP.  You must pass either at least 1 AuthMethod or an authSig
    *   `params.expiration` **[String][143]** When this session signature will expire.  The user will have to reauthenticate after this time using whatever auth method you set up.  This means you will have to call this signSessionKey function again to get a new session signature.  This is a RFC3339 timestamp.  The default is 24 hours from now.
    *   `params.resources`   (optional, default `[]`)
    *   `params.chain`  

Returns **[Object][140]** An object containing the resulting signature.

### getSignedChainDataToken

Request a signed JWT of any solidity function call from the LIT network.  There are no prerequisites for this function.  You should use this function if you need to transmit information across chains, or from a blockchain to a centralized DB or server.  The signature of the returned JWT verifies that the response is genuine.

#### Parameters

*   `params` **[Object][140]** 

    *   `params.callRequests` **[Array][145]<[CallRequest][146]>** The call requests to make.  The responses will be signed and returned.

### getSessionSigs

Get session signatures for a set of resources

#### Parameters

*   `params` **[Object][140]** 

    *   `params.expiration` **[String][143]** When this session signature will expire.  The user will have to reauthenticate after this time using whatever auth method you set up.  This means you will have to call this signSessionKey function again to get a new session signature.  This is a RFC3339 timestamp.  The default is 24 hours from now.
    *   `params.chain` **[String][143]** The chain to use for the session signature.  This is the chain that will be used to sign the session key.  If you're using EVM then this probably doesn't matter at all.
    *   `params.resources` **[Array][145]<[String][143]>** These are the resources that will be signed with the session key.  You may pass a wildcard that allows these session signatures to work with any resource on Lit.  To see a list of resources, check out the docs: [https://developer.litprotocol.com/sdk/explanation/walletsigs/sessionsigs/#resources-you-can-request][152] (optional, default `[]`)
    *   `params.sessionCapabilities` **[Array][145]<[String][143]>** An optional list of capabilities that you want to request for this session.  If you pass nothing, then this will default to a wildcard for each type of resource you're accessing.  For example, if you passed \["litEncryptionCondition://123456"] then this would default to \["litEncryptionConditionCapability://\*"], which would grant this session signature the ability to decrypt any resource.
    *   `params.switchChain` **bool** If you want to ask Metamask to try and switch the user's chain, you may pass true here.  This will only work if the user is using Metamask.  If the user is not using Metamask, then this will be ignored.
    *   `params.authNeededCallback` **[Function][153]** This is a callback that will be called if the user needs to authenticate using a PKP.  For example, if the user has no wallet, but owns a Lit PKP though something like Google Oauth, then you can use this callback to prompt the user to authenticate with their PKP.  This callback should use the LitNodeClient.signSessionKey function to get a session signature for the user from their PKP.  If you don't pass this callback, then the user will be prompted to authenticate with their wallet, like metamask.
    *   `params.sessionKey`  

Returns **[Object][140]** An object containing the resulting signature.

### connect

    *   `params.evmContractConditions` **[Array][145]<[EVMContractCondition][148]>** EVM Smart Contract access control conditions that the user must meet to obtain this signed token.  This could be posession of an NFT, for example.  This is different than accessControlConditions because accessControlConditions only supports a limited number of contract calls.  evmContractConditions supports any contract call.  You must pass either accessControlConditions or evmContractConditions or solRpcConditions or unifiedAccessControlConditions.
    *   `params.solRpcConditions` **[Array][145]<[SolRpcCondition][149]>** Solana RPC call conditions that the user must meet to obtain this signed token.  This could be posession of an NFT, for example.
    *   `params.unifiedAccessControlConditions` **[Array][145]<([AccessControlCondition][147] | [EVMContractCondition][148] | [SolRpcCondition][149])>** An array of unified access control conditions.  You may use AccessControlCondition, EVMContractCondition, or SolRpcCondition objects in this array, but make sure you add a conditionType for each one.

    *   `params.readme` **[string][143]** An optional readme text that will be inserted into readme.txt in the final zip file.  This is useful in case someone comes across this zip file and wants to know how to decrypt it.  This file could contain instructions and a URL to use to decrypt the file.

Returns **[Promise][154]<[Object][140]>** A promise containing an object with 3 keys: zipBlob, encryptedSymmetricKey, and symmetricKey.  zipBlob is a zip file that contains an encrypted file and the metadata needed to decrypt it via the Lit network.  encryptedSymmetricKey is the symmetric key needed to decrypt the content, encrypted with the Lit network public key.  You may wish to store encryptedSymmetricKey in your own database to support quicker re-encryption operations when adding additional access control conditions in the future, but this is entirely optional, and this key is already stored inside the zipBlob.  symmetricKey is the raw symmetric key used to encrypt the files.  DO NOT STORE IT.  It is provided in case you wish to create additional "OR" access control conditions for the same file.

## decryptZipFileWithMetadata

Given a zip file with metadata inside it, unzip, load the metadata, and return the decrypted file and the metadata.  This zip file would have been created with the encryptFileAndZipWithMetadata function.

## Dynamic Content - Loading content from a server



## verifyJwt

Verify a JWT from the LIT network.  Use this for auth on your server.  For some background, users can define resources (URLs) for authorization via on-chain conditions using the saveSigningCondition function.  Other users can then request a signed JWT proving that their ETH account meets those on-chain conditions using the getSignedToken function.  Then, servers can verify that JWT using this function.  A successful verification proves that the user meets the on-chain conditions defined in the saveSigningCondition step.  For example, the on-chain condition could be posession of a specific NFT.

### Parameters

*   `params` **[Object][140]** 

    *   `params.jwt` **[string][143]** A JWT signed by the LIT network using the BLS12-381 algorithm

Returns **[Object][140]** An object with 4 keys: "verified": A boolean that represents whether or not the token verifies successfully.  A true result indicates that the token was successfully verified.  "header": the JWT header.  "payload": the JWT payload which includes the resource being authorized, etc.  "signature": A uint8array that represents the raw  signature of the JWT.

## Authentication Signature Utilities

### Parameters

*   `params` **[Object][140]** 

    *   `params.chain` **[string][143]** The chain you want to use.  Find the supported list of chains here: [https://developer.litprotocol.com/docs/supportedChains][158]

Whether or not to ask Metamask or the user's wallet to switch chains before signing.  This may be desired if you're going to have the user send a txn on that chain.  On the other hand, if all you care about is the user's wallet signature, then you probably don't want to make them switch chains for no reason.  Pass false here to disable this chain switching behavior. (optional, default `true`)
    *   `params.expiration`  
    *   `params.uri`  

Returns **[AuthSig][144]** The AuthSig created or retrieved

*   `method` **[string][143]** The smart contract function to call
*   `parameters` **[Array][145]** The parameters to use when calling the smart contract.  You can use the special ":userAddress" parameter which will be replaced with the requesting user's wallet address, verified via message signature
*   `returnValueTest` **[Object][140]** An object containing two keys: "comparator" and "value".  The return value of the smart contract function will be compared against these.  For example, to check if someone holds an NFT, you could use "comparator: >" and "value: 0" which would check that a user has a token balance greater than zero.

## EVMContractCondition

### Properties

*   `contractAddress` **[string][143]** The address of the contract that will be queried
*   `chain` **[string][143]** The chain name of the chain that this contract is deployed on.  See LIT_CHAINS for currently supported chains.
*   `functionName` **[string][143]** The smart contract function to call

*   `returnValueTest` **[Object][140]** An object containing three keys: "key", "comparator" and "value".  The return value of the smart contract function will be compared against these.  For example, to check if someone holds an NFT, you could use "key": "", "comparator: >" and "value: 0" which would check that a user has a token balance greater than zero.  The "key" is used when the return value is a struct which contains multiple values and should be the name of the returned value from the function abi.  You must always pass "key" when using "returnValueTest", even if you pass an empty string for it, because the function only returns a single value.

The "key" selector supports JSONPath syntax, so you can filter and iterate over the results.  For example, to check if someone holds an NFT with address 29G6GSKNGP8K6ATy65QrNZk4rNgsZX1sttvb5iLXWDcE, you could use "method": "GetTokenAccountsByOwner", "params": \[":userAddress",{"programId":"TokenkegQfeZyiNwAJbNbGKPFXCWuBvf9Ss623VQ5DA"},{"encoding":"jsonParsed"}], "key": "$\[?(@.account.data.parsed.info.mint == "29G6GSKNGP8K6ATy65QrNZk4rNgsZX1sttvb5iLXWDcE")].account.data.parsed.info.tokenAmount.amount", "comparator: >" and "value: 0" which would check that a user has a token balance greater than zero.  The "key" is used when the return value is an array or object which contains multiple values and should be the name of the returned value or a JSONPath item.  You must always pass "key" when using "returnValueTest", even if you pass an empty string for it, because the rpc call only returns a single value.

*   `returnValueTest` **[Object][140]** An object containing three keys: "key", "comparator" and "value".  The return value of the rpc call will be compared against these.  The "key" selector supports JSONPath syntax, so you can filter and iterate over the results.  For example, to check the balance of someone's account, you can use the key "$.balances\[0].amount" which will pull out balances\[0].amount from the JSON response and compare it against the "value" field according to the "comparator".  The "key" is used when the return value is an array or object which contains multiple values and should be the name of the returned value or a JSONPath item.  You must always pass "key" when using "returnValueTest", even if you pass an empty string for it, because the rpc call only returns a single value.

Returns **[Promise][154]\<CryptoKey>** A promise that resolves to the imported key

## generateSymmetricKey

Generate a new random symmetric key using WebCrypto subtle API.  You should only use this if you're handling your own key generation and management with Lit.  Typically, Lit handles this internally for you.

Returns **[Promise][154]\<CryptoKey>** A promise that resolves to the generated key

## encryptWithPubKey

Encrypt a blob with the public key of a receiver

### Parameters

*   `receiverPublicKey` **[string][143]** The base64 encoded 32 byte public key.  The corresponding private key will be able to decrypt this blob
*   `data` **[Blob][155]** The blob to encrypt
*   `version` **[string][143]** The encryption algorithm to use.  This should be set to "x25519-xsalsa20-poly1305" as no other algorithms are implemented right now.

Returns **[Blob][155]** The encrypted blob

## decryptWithPrivKey

Decrypt a blob with a private key

### Parameters

*   `encryptedData` **[Blob][155]** The blob to decrypt
*   `receiverPrivateKey` **[string][143]** The base64 encoded 32 byte private key.  The corresponding public key was used to encrypt this blob
*   `version` **[string][143]** The encryption algorithm to use.  This should be set to "x25519-xsalsa20-poly1305" as no other algorithms are implemented right now.

Returns **[Blob][155]** The decrypted blob

## decimalPlaces

Get the number of decimal places in a token

### Parameters

*   `params` **[Object][140]** 

    *   `params.contractAddress` **[string][143]** The token contract address
    *   `params.chain` **[string][143]** The chain on which the token is deployed

Returns **[number][142]** The number of decimal places in the token

## lookupNameServiceAddress

Lookup an eth address from a given ENS name

### Parameters

*   `params` **[Object][140]** 

    *   `params.chain` **[string][143]** The chain on which to resolve the name
    *   `params.name` **[string][143]** The name to resolve

Returns **[string][143]** The resolved eth address

## metadataForFile

Get all the metadata needed to decrypt something in the future.  If you're encrypting files with Lit and storing them in IPFS or Arweave, then this function will provide you with a properly formatted metadata object that you should save alongside the files.

### Parameters

*   `params` **[Object][140]** 

    *   `params.accessControlConditions` **[Array][145]** The array of access control conditions defined for the object
    *   `params.chain` **[string][143]** The blockchain on which the access control conditions should be checked
    *   `params.encryptedSymmetricKey` **[Uint8Array][151]** The encrypted symmetric key that was returned by the LitNodeClient.saveEncryptionKey function
    *   `params.objectUrl` **[string][143]** The url to the object, like an IPFS or Arweave url.
    *   `params.name`  
    *   `params.type`  
    *   `params.size`  
    *   `params.evmContractConditions`  
    *   `params.solRpcConditions`  
    *   `params.unifiedAccessControlConditions`  

Returns **[Object][140]** An object with 3 keys: "verified": A boolean that represents whether or not the token verifies successfully.  A true result indicates that the token was successfully verified.  "header": the JWT header.  "payload": the JWT payload which includes the resource being authorized, etc.

## CallRequest

Type: [Object][140]

### Properties

*   `to` **[string][143]** The address of the contract that will be queried
*   `from` **[string][143]** Optional.  The address calling the function.
*   `data` **[string][143]** Hex encoded data to send to the contract.
