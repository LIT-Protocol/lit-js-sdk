## Welcome

Welcome to the LIT JS SDK API documentation.  To understand how these functions fit together, please view the documentation for this SDK, located at [https://developer.litprotocol.com/docs/SDK/intro][118]

## LitNodeClient

A LIT node client.  Connects directly to the LIT nodes to store and retrieve encryption keys and signing requests.  Only holders of an NFT that corresponds with a LIT may store and retrieve the keys.

### Parameters

*   `config` **[Object][119]** 

    *   `config.alertWhenUnauthorized` **[boolean][120]** Whether or not to show a JS alert() when a user tries to unlock a LIT but is unauthorized.  An exception will also be thrown regardless of this option. (optional, default `true`)
    *   `config.minNodeCount` **[number][121]** The minimum number of nodes that must be connected for the LitNodeClient to be ready to use. (optional, default `6`)
    *   `config.debug` **[boolean][120]** Whether or not to show debug messages. (optional, default `true`)

### getSignedChainDataToken

Request a signed JWT of any solidity function call from the LIT network.  There are no prerequisites for this function.  You should use this function if you need to transmit information across chains, or from a blockchain to a centralized DB or server.  The signature of the returned JWT verifies that the response is genuine.

#### Parameters

*   `params` **[Object][119]** 

    *   `params.callRequests` **[Array][122]<[CallRequest][123]>** The call requests to make.  The responses will be signed and returned.
    *   `params.chain` **[string][124]** The chain name of the chain that this contract is deployed on.  See LIT_CHAINS for currently supported chains.

Returns **[Object][119]** A signed JWT that proves the response to the function call is genuine. You may present this to a smart contract, or a server for authorization, and it can be verified using the verifyJwt function.

### getSignedToken

Request a signed JWT from the LIT network.  Before calling this function, you must either create or know of a resource id and access control conditions for the item you wish to gain authorization for.  You can create an access control condition using the saveSigningCondition function.

#### Parameters

*   `params` **[Object][119]** 

    *   `params.accessControlConditions` **[Array][122]<[AccessControlCondition][125]>** The access control conditions that the user must meet to obtain this signed token.

Returns **[Blob][132]** The encrypted blob

## Dynamic Content - Loading content from a server



## verifyJwt

Verify a JWT from the LIT network.  Use this for auth on your server.  For some background, users can define resources (URLs) for authorization via on-chain conditions using the saveSigningCondition function.  Other users can then request a signed JWT proving that their ETH account meets those on-chain conditions using the getSignedToken function.  Then, servers can verify that JWT using this function.  A successful verification proves that the user meets the on-chain conditions defined in the saveSigningCondition step.  For example, the on-chain condition could be posession of a specific NFT.

### Parameters

*   `params` **[Object][119]** 

    *   `params.jwt` **[string][124]** A JWT signed by the LIT network using the BLS12-381 algorithm

Returns **[Object][119]** An object with 4 keys: "verified": A boolean that represents whether or not the token verifies successfully.  A true result indicates that the token was successfully verified.  "header": the JWT header.  "payload": the JWT payload which includes the resource being authorized, etc.  "signature": A uint8array that represents the raw  signature of the JWT.

## Authentication Signature Utilities



## checkAndSignAuthMessage

Check for an existing cryptographic authentication signature and create one of it does not exist.  This is used to prove ownership of a given crypto wallet address to the Lit nodes.  The result is stored in LocalStorage so the user doesn't have to sign every time they perform an operation.

### Parameters

*   `params` **[Object][119]** 

    *   `params.chain` **[string][124]** The chain you want to use.  Find the supported list of chains here: [https://developer.litprotocol.com/docs/supportedChains][134]
    *   `params.resources` **[Array][122]<[string][124]>** Optional and only used with EVM chains.  A list of resources to be passed to Sign In with Ethereum.  These resources will be part of the Sign in with Ethereum signed message presented to the user.
    *   `params.switchChain` **[Array][122]<[boolean][120]>** Optional and only used with EVM chains right now.  Set to true by default.  Whether or not to ask Metamask or the user's wallet to switch chains before signing.  This may be desired if you're going to have the user send a txn on that chain.  On the other hand, if all you care about is the user's wallet signature, then you probably don't want to make them switch chains for no reason.  Pass false here to disable this chain switching behavior. (optional, default `true`)

Returns **[AuthSig][128]** The AuthSig created or retrieved

## signAndSaveAuthMessage

Sign the auth message with the user's wallet, and store it in localStorage.  Called by checkAndSignAuthMessage if the user does not have a signature stored.

### Parameters

## mintLIT

This function mints a LIT using our pre-deployed token contracts.  You may use our contracts, or you may supply your own.  Our contracts are ERC1155 tokens on Polygon and Ethereum.  Using these contracts is the easiest way to get started.

### Parameters

*   `params` **[Object][119]** 

    *   `params.chain` **[string][124]** The chain to mint on.  "ethereum" and "polygon" are currently supported.

## unlockLitWithKey

Manually unlock a LIT with a symmetric key.  You can obtain this key by calling "checkAndSignAuthMessage" to get an authSig, then calling "LitNodeClient.getEncryptionKey" to get the key.  If you want to see an example, check out the implementation of "toggleLock" which does all those operations and then calls this function at the end (unlockLitWithKey)

### Parameters

*   `params` **[Object][119]** 

    *   `params.symmetricKey` **[Uint8Array][130]** The decryption key obtained by calling "LitNodeClient.getEncryptionKey"

Returns **[promise][131]** A promise that will resolve when the LIT is unlocked

## toggleLock

Lock and unlock the encrypted content inside a LIT.  This content is only viewable by holders of the NFT that corresponds to this LIT.  Locked content will be decrypted and placed into the HTML element with id "mediaGridHolder".  The HTML element with the id "lockedHeader" will have it's text automatically changed to LOCKED or UNLOCKED to denote the state of the LIT.  Note that if you're creating a LIT using the createHtmlLIT function, you do not need to use this function, because this function is automatically bound to any button in your HTML with the id "unlockButton".

Returns **[Promise][131]** the promise will resolve when the LIT has been unlocked or an error message has been shown informing the user that they are not authorized to unlock the LIT

## injectViewerIFrame

Inject an iFrame into the current page that will display a LIT.  This function safely sandboxes the content in the iFrame so that the LIT cannot see cookies or localStorage of the parent website.

### Parameters

### Properties

*   `contractAddress` **[string][124]** The address of the contract that will be queried
*   `chain` **[string][124]** The chain name of the chain that this contract is deployed on.  See LIT_CHAINS for currently supported chains.
*   `standardContractType` **[string][124]** If the contract is an ERC20, ERC721, or ERC1155, please put that here
*   `method` **[string][124]** The smart contract function to call
*   `parameters` **[Array][122]** The parameters to use when calling the smart contract.  You can use the special ":userAddress" parameter which will be replaced with the requesting user's wallet address, verified via message signature
*   `returnValueTest` **[Object][119]** An object containing two keys: "comparator" and "value".  The return value of the smart contract function will be compared against these.  For example, to check if someone holds an NFT, you could use "comparator: >" and "value: 0" which would check that a user has a token balance greater than zero.

## EVMContractCondition

Type: [Object][119]

### Properties

*   `contractAddress` **[string][124]** The address of the contract that will be queried
*   `chain` **[string][124]** The chain name of the chain that this contract is deployed on.  See LIT_CHAINS for currently supported chains.
*   `functionName` **[string][124]** The smart contract function to call
*   `functionParams` **[Array][122]** The parameters to use when calling the smart contract.  You can use the special ":userAddress" parameter which will be replaced with the requesting user's wallet address, verified via message signature
*   `functionAbi` **[Object][119]** The ABI of the smart contract function to call.  This is used to encode the function parameters and decode the return value of the function.  Do not pass the entire contract ABI here.  Instead, find the function you want to call in the contract ABI and pass that function's ABI here.
*   `returnValueTest` **[Object][119]** An object containing three keys: "key", "comparator" and "value".  The return value of the smart contract function will be compared against these.  For example, to check if someone holds an NFT, you could use "key": "", "comparator: >" and "value: 0" which would check that a user has a token balance greater than zero.  The "key" is used when the return value is a struct which contains multiple values and should be the name of the returned value from the function abi.  You must always pass "key" when using "returnValueTest", even if you pass an empty string for it, because the function only returns a single value.

## SolRpcCondition

Type: [Object][119]

The "key" selector supports JSONPath syntax, so you can filter and iterate over the results.  For example, to check if someone holds an NFT with address 29G6GSKNGP8K6ATy65QrNZk4rNgsZX1sttvb5iLXWDcE, you could use "method": "GetTokenAccountsByOwner", "params": \[":userAddress",{"programId":"TokenkegQfeZyiNwAJbNbGKPFXCWuBvf9Ss623VQ5DA"},{"encoding":"jsonParsed"}], "key": "$\[?(@.account.data.parsed.info.mint == "29G6GSKNGP8K6ATy65QrNZk4rNgsZX1sttvb5iLXWDcE")].account.data.parsed.info.tokenAmount.amount", "comparator: >" and "value: 0" which would check that a user has a token balance greater than zero.  The "key" is used when the return value is an array or object which contains multiple values and should be the name of the returned value or a JSONPath item.  You must always pass "key" when using "returnValueTest", even if you pass an empty string for it, because the rpc call only returns a single value.

## CosmosCondition

*   `returnValueTest` **[Object][119]** An object containing three keys: "key", "comparator" and "value".  The return value of the rpc call will be compared against these.  The "key" selector supports JSONPath syntax, so you can filter and iterate over the results.  For example, to check the balance of someone's account, you can use the key "$.balances\[0].amount" which will pull out balances\[0].amount from the JSON response and compare it against the "value" field according to the "comparator".  The "key" is used when the return value is an array or object which contains multiple values and should be the name of the returned value or a JSONPath item.  You must always pass "key" when using "returnValueTest", even if you pass an empty string for it, because the rpc call only returns a single value.
