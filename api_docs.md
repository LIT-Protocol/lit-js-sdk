## Welcome

Welcome to the LIT JS SDK API documentation.  To understand how these functions fit together, please view the documentation for this SDK, located at [https://developer.litprotocol.com/docs/SDK/intro][135]

## LitNodeClient

A LIT node client.  Connects directly to the LIT nodes to store and retrieve encryption keys and signing requests.  Only holders of an NFT that corresponds with a LIT may store and retrieve the keys.

### Parameters

*   `config` **[Object][136]** 

    *   `config.alertWhenUnauthorized` **[boolean][137]** Whether or not to show a JS alert() when a user tries to unlock a LIT but is unauthorized.  An exception will also be thrown regardless of this option. (optional, default `true`)
    *   `config.minNodeCount` **[number][138]** The minimum number of nodes that must be connected for the LitNodeClient to be ready to use. (optional, default `6`)
    *   `config.debug` **[boolean][137]** Whether or not to show debug messages. (optional, default `true`)

### executeJs

Execute JS on the nodes and combine and return any resulting signatures

#### Parameters

*   `params` **[Object][136]** 

    *   `params.code` **[string][139]** JS code to run on the nodes
    *   `params.ipfsId` **[string][139]** The IPFS ID of some JS code to run on the nodes
    *   `params.authSig` **[AuthSig][140]** the authSig to use to authorize the user with the nodes
    *   `params.jsParams` **[Object][136]** An object that contains params to expose to the Lit Action.  These will be injected to the JS runtime before your code runs, so you can use any of these as normal variables in your Lit Action. (optional, default `{}`)
    *   `params.debug` **[Boolean][137]** A boolean that defines if debug info will be returned or not.
    *   `params.authMethods`   (optional, default `[]`)

Returns **[Object][136]** An object containing the resulting signatures.  Each signature comes with the public key and the data signed.

### getSignedChainDataToken

Request a signed JWT of any solidity function call from the LIT network.  There are no prerequisites for this function.  You should use this function if you need to transmit information across chains, or from a blockchain to a centralized DB or server.  The signature of the returned JWT verifies that the response is genuine.

#### Parameters

*   `params` **[Object][136]** 

    *   `params.callRequests` **[Array][141]<[CallRequest][142]>** The call requests to make.  The responses will be signed and returned.

Returns **[Object][136]** A signed JWT that proves the response to the function call is genuine. You may present this to a smart contract, or a server for authorization, and it can be verified using the verifyJwt function.

### getSignedToken

Request a signed JWT from the LIT network.  Before calling this function, you must either create or know of a resource id and access control conditions for the item you wish to gain authorization for.  You can create an access control condition using the saveSigningCondition function.

#### Parameters

*   `params` **[Object][136]** 

    *   `params.accessControlConditions` **[Array][141]<[AccessControlCondition][143]>** The access control conditions that the user must meet to obtain this signed token.

    *   `params.readme` **[string][139]** An optional readme text that will be inserted into readme.txt in the final zip file.  This is useful in case someone comes across this zip file and wants to know how to decrypt it.  This file could contain instructions and a URL to use to decrypt the file.

Returns **[Promise][148]<[Object][136]>** A promise containing an object with 3 keys: zipBlob, encryptedSymmetricKey, and symmetricKey.  zipBlob is a zip file that contains an encrypted file and the metadata needed to decrypt it via the Lit network.  encryptedSymmetricKey is the symmetric key needed to decrypt the content, encrypted with the Lit network public key.  You may wish to store encryptedSymmetricKey in your own database to support quicker re-encryption operations when adding additional access control conditions in the future, but this is entirely optional, and this key is already stored inside the zipBlob.  symmetricKey is the raw symmetric key used to encrypt the files.  DO NOT STORE IT.  It is provided in case you wish to create additional "OR" access control conditions for the same file.

## decryptZipFileWithMetadata

Given a zip file with metadata inside it, unzip, load the metadata, and return the decrypted file and the metadata.  This zip file would have been created with the encryptFileAndZipWithMetadata function.

## Dynamic Content - Loading content from a server



## verifyJwt

Verify a JWT from the LIT network.  Use this for auth on your server.  For some background, users can define resources (URLs) for authorization via on-chain conditions using the saveSigningCondition function.  Other users can then request a signed JWT proving that their ETH account meets those on-chain conditions using the getSignedToken function.  Then, servers can verify that JWT using this function.  A successful verification proves that the user meets the on-chain conditions defined in the saveSigningCondition step.  For example, the on-chain condition could be posession of a specific NFT.

### Parameters

*   `params` **[Object][136]** 

    *   `params.jwt` **[string][139]** A JWT signed by the LIT network using the BLS12-381 algorithm

Returns **[Object][136]** An object with 4 keys: "verified": A boolean that represents whether or not the token verifies successfully.  A true result indicates that the token was successfully verified.  "header": the JWT header.  "payload": the JWT payload which includes the resource being authorized, etc.  "signature": A uint8array that represents the raw  signature of the JWT.

## Authentication Signature Utilities



## checkAndSignAuthMessage

Check for an existing cryptographic authentication signature and create one of it does not exist.  This is used to prove ownership of a given crypto wallet address to the Lit nodes.  The result is stored in LocalStorage so the user doesn't have to sign every time they perform an operation.

### Parameters

*   `params` **[Object][136]** 

    *   `params.chain` **[string][139]** The chain you want to use.  Find the supported list of chains here: [https://developer.litprotocol.com/docs/supportedChains][152]

Whether or not to ask Metamask or the user's wallet to switch chains before signing.  This may be desired if you're going to have the user send a txn on that chain.  On the other hand, if all you care about is the user's wallet signature, then you probably don't want to make them switch chains for no reason.  Pass false here to disable this chain switching behavior. (optional, default `true`)
    *   `params.expiration`  
    *   `params.uri`  

Returns **[AuthSig][140]** The AuthSig created or retrieved

*   `returnValueTest` **[Object][136]** An object containing three keys: "key", "comparator" and "value".  The return value of the smart contract function will be compared against these.  For example, to check if someone holds an NFT, you could use "key": "", "comparator: >" and "value: 0" which would check that a user has a token balance greater than zero.  The "key" is used when the return value is a struct which contains multiple values and should be the name of the returned value from the function abi.  You must always pass "key" when using "returnValueTest", even if you pass an empty string for it, because the function only returns a single value.

*   `returnValueTest` **[Object][136]** An object containing three keys: "key", "comparator" and "value".  The return value of the rpc call will be compared against these.  The "key" selector supports JSONPath syntax, so you can filter and iterate over the results.  For example, to check the balance of someone's account, you can use the key "$.balances\[0].amount" which will pull out balances\[0].amount from the JSON response and compare it against the "value" field according to the "comparator".  The "key" is used when the return value is an array or object which contains multiple values and should be the name of the returned value or a JSONPath item.  You must always pass "key" when using "returnValueTest", even if you pass an empty string for it, because the rpc call only returns a single value.
