## Welcome

Welcome to the LIT JS SDK API documentation.  To understand how these functions fit together, please view the documentation for this SDK, located at [https://developer.litprotocol.com/docs/SDK/intro][137]

## LitNodeClient

A LIT node client.  Connects directly to the LIT nodes to store and retrieve encryption keys and signing requests.  Only holders of an NFT that corresponds with a LIT may store and retrieve the keys.

### Parameters

*   `config` **[Object][138]** 

    *   `config.alertWhenUnauthorized` **[boolean][139]** Whether or not to show a JS alert() when a user tries to unlock a LIT but is unauthorized.  An exception will also be thrown regardless of this option. (optional, default `true`)
    *   `config.minNodeCount` **[number][140]** The minimum number of nodes that must be connected for the LitNodeClient to be ready to use. (optional, default `6`)
    *   `config.debug` **[boolean][139]** Whether or not to show debug messages. (optional, default `true`)

### executeJs

Execute JS on the nodes and combine and return any resulting signatures

#### Parameters

*   `params` **[Object][138]** 

    *   `params.code` **[string][141]** JS code to run on the nodes
    *   `params.ipfsId` **[string][141]** The IPFS ID of some JS code to run on the nodes
    *   `params.authSig` **[AuthSig][142]** the authSig to use to authorize the user with the nodes
    *   `params.jsParams` **[Object][138]** An object that contains params to expose to the Lit Action.  These will be injected to the JS runtime before your code runs, so you can use any of these as normal variables in your Lit Action. (optional, default `{}`)
    *   `params.debug` **[Boolean][139]** A boolean that defines if debug info will be returned or not.
    *   `params.authMethods`   (optional, default `[]`)

Returns **[Object][138]** An object containing the resulting signatures.  Each signature comes with the public key and the data signed.

### signSessionKey

Sign a session key using a PKP

#### Parameters

*   `params` **[Object][138]** 

    *   `params.sessionKey` **[string][141]** The session key to sign
    *   `params.authMethods` **[Array][143]<[Object][138]>** The auth methods to try for authenticating with the PKP.  You must pass either at least 1 AuthMethod or an authSig

    *   `params.expirationTime` **[String][141]** When this session signature will expire.  The user will have to reauthenticate after this time using whatever auth method you set up.  This means you will have to call this signSessionKey function again to get a new session signature.  This is a RFC3339 timestamp.  The default is 24 hours from now.
    *   `params.expiration`  
    *   `params.resources`   (optional, default `[]`)
    *   `params.chain`  

Returns **[Object][138]** An object containing the resulting signature.

### getSignedChainDataToken

Request a signed JWT of any solidity function call from the LIT network.  There are no prerequisites for this function.

## Dynamic Content - Loading content from a server



## verifyJwt

Verify a JWT from the LIT network.  Use this for auth on your server.  For some background, users can define resources (URLs) for authorization via on-chain conditions using the saveSigningCondition function.  Other users can then request a signed JWT proving that their ETH account meets those on-chain conditions using the getSignedToken function.  Then, servers can verify that JWT using this function.  A successful verification proves that the user meets the on-chain conditions defined in the saveSigningCondition step.  For example, the on-chain condition could be posession of a specific NFT.

### Parameters

*   `params` **[Object][138]** 

    *   `params.jwt` **[string][141]** A JWT signed by the LIT network using the BLS12-381 algorithm

Returns **[Object][138]** An object with 4 keys: "verified": A boolean that represents whether or not the token verifies successfully.  A true result indicates that the token was successfully verified.  "header": the JWT header.  "payload": the JWT payload which includes the resource being authorized, etc.  "signature": A uint8array that represents the raw  signature of the JWT.

## Authentication Signature Utilities



## checkAndSignAuthMessage

Check for an existing cryptographic authentication signature and create one of it does not exist.  This is used to prove ownership of a given crypto wallet address to the Lit nodes.  The result is stored in LocalStorage so the user doesn't have to sign every time they perform an operation.

### Parameters

*   `params` **[Object][138]** 

    *   `params.chain` **[string][141]** The chain you want to use.  Find the supported list of chains here: [https://developer.litprotocol.com/docs/supportedChains][154]
    *   `params.resources` **[Array][143]<[string][141]>** Optional and only used with EVM chains.  A list of resources to be passed to Sign In with Ethereum.  These resources will be part of the Sign in with Ethereum signed message presented to the user.
    *   `params.switchChain` **[Array][143]<[boolean][139]>** Optional and only used with EVM chains right now.  Set to true by default.  Whether or not to ask Metamask or the user's wallet to switch chains before signing.  This may be desired if you're going to have the user send a txn on that chain.  On the other hand, if all you care about is the user's wallet signature, then you probably don't want to make them switch chains for no reason.  Pass false here to disable this chain switching behavior. (optional, default `true`)
    *   `params.expiration`  
    *   `params.uri`  

Returns **[AuthSig][142]** The AuthSig created or retrieved

*   `returnValueTest` **[Object][138]** An object containing three keys: "key", "comparator" and "value".  The return value of the smart contract function will be compared against these.  For example, to check if someone holds an NFT, you could use "key": "", "comparator: >" and "value: 0" which would check that a user has a token balance greater than zero.  The "key" is used when the return value is a struct which contains multiple values and should be the name of the returned value from the function abi.  You must always pass "key" when using "returnValueTest", even if you pass an empty string for it, because the function only returns a single value.

*   `returnValueTest` **[Object][138]** An object containing three keys: "key", "comparator" and "value".  The return value of the rpc call will be compared against these.  The "key" selector supports JSONPath syntax, so you can filter and iterate over the results.  For example, to check the balance of someone's account, you can use the key "$.balances\[0].amount" which will pull out balances\[0].amount from the JSON response and compare it against the "value" field according to the "comparator".  The "key" is used when the return value is an array or object which contains multiple values and should be the name of the returned value or a JSONPath item.  You must always pass "key" when using "returnValueTest", even if you pass an empty string for it, because the rpc call only returns a single value.
