## Welcome

Welcome to the LIT JS SDK API documentation.  To understand how these functions fit together, please view the README in the github repo for this SDK, located at [https://github.com/LIT-Protocol/lit-js-sdk/blob/main/README.md][85]

## mintLIT

This function mints a LIT using our pre-deployed token contracts.  You may use our contracts, or you may supply your own.  Our contracts are ERC1155 tokens on Polygon and Ethereum.  Using these contracts is the easiest way to get started.

### Parameters

*   `params` **[Object][86]** 

    *   `params.chain` **[string][87]** The chain to mint on.  "ethereum" and "polygon" are currently supported.
    *   `params.quantity` **[number][88]** The number of tokens to mint.  Note that these will be fungible, so they will not have serial numbers.

Returns **[Object][86]** The txHash, tokenId, tokenAddress, mintingAddress, and authSig.

## LitNodeClient

A LIT node client.  Connects directly to the LIT nodes to store and retrieve encryption keys and signing requests.  Only holders of an NFT that corresponds with a LIT may store and retrieve the keys.

### Parameters

*   `config` **[Object][86]** 

    *   `config.alertWhenUnauthorized` **[boolean][89]** Whether or not to show a JS alert() when a user tries to unlock a LIT but is unauthorized.  An exception will also be thrown regardless of this option. (optional, default `true`)
    *   `config.minNodeCount` **[number][88]** The minimum number of nodes that must be connected for the LitNodeClient to be ready to use. (optional, default `6`)

### getSignedChainDataToken

Request a signed JWT of any solidity function call from the LIT network.  There are no prerequisites for this function.  You should use this function if you need to transmit information across chains, or from a blockchain to a centralized DB or server.  The signature of the returned JWT verifies that the response is genuine.

#### Parameters

*   `params` **[Object][86]** 

    *   `params.callRequests` **[Array][90]<[CallRequest][91]>** The call requests to make.  The responses will be signed and returned.
    *   `params.chain` **[string][87]** The chain name of the chain that this contract is deployed on.  See LIT_CHAINS for currently supported chains.

Returns **[Object][86]** A signed JWT that proves the response to the function call is genuine. You may present this to a smart contract, or a server for authorization, and it can be verified using the verifyJwt function.

### getSignedToken

Request a signed JWT from the LIT network.  Before calling this function, you must either create or know of a resource id and access control conditions for the item you wish to gain authorization for.  You can create an access control condition using the saveSigningCondition function.

#### Parameters

*   `params` **[Object][86]** 

    *   `params.accessControlConditions` **[Array][90]<[AccessControlCondition][92]>** The access control conditions that the user must meet to obtain this signed token.  This could be posession of an NFT, for example.

    *   `params.resourceId` **[ResourceId][94]** The resourceId representing something on the web via a URL

Returns **[Object][86]** A signed JWT that proves you meet the access control conditions for the given resource id.  You may present this to a server for authorization, and the server can verify it using the verifyJwt function.

### saveSigningCondition

Associated access control conditions with a resource on the web.  After calling this function, users may use the getSignedToken function to request a signed JWT from the LIT network.  This JWT proves that the user meets the access control conditions, and is authorized to access the resource you specified in the resourceId parameter of the saveSigningCondition function.

#### Parameters

*   `params` **[Object][86]**

### getEncryptionKey

Retrieve the symmetric encryption key from the LIT nodes.  Note that this will only work if the current user meets the access control conditions specified when the data was encrypted.  That access control condition is typically that the user is a holder of the NFT that corresponds to this encrypted data.  This NFT token address and ID was specified when this LIT was created.

#### Parameters

*   `params` **[Object][86]** 

    *   `params.accessControlConditions` **[Array][90]<[AccessControlCondition][92]>** The access control conditions that the user must meet to obtain the encryption key, used to decrypt the data.  This could be posession of an NFT, for example.

### connect

Connect to the LIT nodes.

Returns **[Promise][96]** A promise that resolves when the nodes are connected.

## unlockLitWithKey

Manually unlock a LIT with a symmetric key.  You can obtain this key by calling "checkAndSignAuthMessage" to get an authSig, then calling "LitNodeClient.getEncryptionKey" to get the key.  If you want to see an example, check out the implementation of "toggleLock" which does all those operations and then calls this function at the end (unlockLitWithKey)

### Parameters

*   `params` **[Object][86]** 

    *   `params.symmetricKey` **[Uint8Array][95]** The decryption key obtained by calling "LitNodeClient.getEncryptionKey"

## verifyJwt

Verify a JWT from the LIT network.  Use this for auth on your server.  For some background, users can define resources (URLs) for authorization via on-chain conditions using the saveSigningCondition function.  Other users can then request a signed JWT proving that their ETH account meets those on-chain conditions using the getSignedToken function.  Then, servers can verify that JWT using this function.  A successful verification proves that the user meets the on-chain conditions defined in the saveSigningCondition step.  For example, the on-chain condition could be posession of a specific NFT.

### Parameters

*   `params` **[Object][86]** 

    *   `params.jwt` **[string][87]** A JWT signed by the LIT network using the BLS12-381 algorithm

Returns **[Object][86]** An object with 4 keys: "verified": A boolean that represents whether or not the token verifies successfully.  A true result indicates that the token was successfully verified.  "header": the JWT header.
