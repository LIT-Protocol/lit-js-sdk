### Parameters

*   `config` **[Object][124]** 

    *   `config.alertWhenUnauthorized` **[boolean][125]** Whether or not to show a JS alert() when a user tries to unlock a LIT but is unauthorized.  An exception will also be thrown regardless of this option. (optional, default `true`)
    *   `config.minNodeCount` **[number][126]** The minimum number of nodes that must be connected for the LitNodeClient to be ready to use. (optional, default `6`)
    *   `config.debug` **[boolean][125]** Whether or not to show debug messages. (optional, default `true`)

### executeJs

    *   `params.ipfsId` **[string][127]** The IPFS ID of some JS code to run on the nodes
    *   `params.authSig` **[AuthSig][128]** the authSig to use to authorize the user with the nodes
    *   `params.jsParams` **[Object][124]** An object that contains params to expose to the Lit Action.  These will be injected to the JS runtime before your code runs, so you can use any of these as normal variables in your Lit Action.
    *   `params.debug` **[Boolean][125]** A boolean that defines if debug info will be returned or not.

Returns **[Object][124]** An object containing the resulting signatures.  Each signature comes with the public key and the data signed.

### getSignedChainDataToken

Request a signed JWT of any solidity function call from the LIT network.  There are no prerequisites for this function.  You should use this function if you need to transmit information across chains, or from a blockchain to a centralized DB or server.  The signature of the returned JWT verifies that the response is genuine.

#### Parameters

*   `params` **[Object][124]** 

    *   `params.callRequests` **[Array][129]<[CallRequest][130]>** The call requests to make.  The responses will be signed and returned.

Other users can then request a signed JWT proving that their ETH account meets those on-chain conditions using the getSignedToken function.  Then, servers can verify that JWT using this function.  A successful verification proves that the user meets the on-chain conditions defined in the saveSigningCondition step.  For example, the on-chain condition could be posession of a specific NFT.

### Parameters

*   `params` **[Object][124]** 

    *   `params.jwt` **[string][127]** A JWT signed by the LIT network using the BLS12-381 algorithm

Returns **[Object][124]** An object with 4 keys: "verified": A boolean that represents whether or not the token verifies successfully.  A true result indicates that the token was successfully verified.  "header": the JWT header.  "payload": the JWT payload which includes the resource being authorized, etc.  "signature": A uint8array that represents the raw  signature of the JWT.

## Authentication Signature Utilities



## checkAndSignAuthMessage

Check for an existing cryptographic authentication signature and create one of it does not exist.  This is used to prove ownership of a given crypto wallet address to the Lit nodes.  The result is stored in LocalStorage so the user doesn't have to sign every time they perform an operation.

### Parameters

## unlockLitWithKey

Manually unlock a LIT with a symmetric key.  You can obtain this key by calling "checkAndSignAuthMessage" to get an authSig, then calling "LitNodeClient.getEncryptionKey" to get the key.  If you want to see an example, check out the implementation of "toggleLock" which does all those operations and then calls this function at the end (unlockLitWithKey)

### Parameters

*   `params` **[Object][124]** 

    *   `params.symmetricKey` **[Uint8Array][135]** The decryption key obtained by calling "LitNodeClient.getEncryptionKey"

The HTML element with the id "lockedHeader" will have it's text automatically changed to LOCKED or UNLOCKED to denote the state of the LIT.  Note that if you're creating a LIT using the createHtmlLIT function, you do not need to use this function, because this function is automatically bound to any button in your HTML with the id "unlockButton".

Returns **[Promise][136]** the promise will resolve when the LIT has been unlocked or an error message has been shown informing the user that they are not authorized to unlock the LIT

## injectViewerIFrame

*   `returnValueTest` **[Object][124]** An object containing two keys: "comparator" and "value".  The return value of the smart contract function will be compared against these.  For example, to check if someone holds an NFT, you could use "comparator: >" and "value: 0" which would check that a user has a token balance greater than zero.

## EVMContractCondition

### Properties

*   `contractAddress` **[string][127]** The address of the contract that will be queried
*   `chain` **[string][127]** The chain name of the chain that this contract is deployed on.  See LIT_CHAINS for currently supported chains.
*   `functionName` **[string][127]** The smart contract function to call

*   `returnValueTest` **[Object][124]** An object containing three keys: "key", "comparator" and "value".  The return value of the smart contract function will be compared against these.  For example, to check if someone holds an NFT, you could use "key": "", "comparator: >" and "value: 0" which would check that a user has a token balance greater than zero.  The "key" is used when the return value is a struct which contains multiple values and should be the name of the returned value from the function abi.  You must always pass "key" when using "returnValueTest", even if you pass an empty string for it, because the function only returns a single value.

The "key" selector supports JSONPath syntax, so you can filter and iterate over the results.  For example, to check if someone holds an NFT with address 29G6GSKNGP8K6ATy65QrNZk4rNgsZX1sttvb5iLXWDcE, you could use "method": "GetTokenAccountsByOwner", "params": \[":userAddress",{"programId":"TokenkegQfeZyiNwAJbNbGKPFXCWuBvf9Ss623VQ5DA"},{"encoding":"jsonParsed"}], "key": "$\[?(@.account.data.parsed.info.mint == "29G6GSKNGP8K6ATy65QrNZk4rNgsZX1sttvb5iLXWDcE")].account.data.parsed.info.tokenAmount.amount", "comparator: >" and "value: 0" which would check that a user has a token balance greater than zero.  The "key" is used when the return value is an array or object which contains multiple values and should be the name of the returned value or a JSONPath item.  You must always pass "key" when using "returnValueTest", even if you pass an empty string for it, because the rpc call only returns a single value.

*   `returnValueTest` **[Object][124]** An object containing three keys: "key", "comparator" and "value".  The return value of the rpc call will be compared against these.  The "key" selector supports JSONPath syntax, so you can filter and iterate over the results.  For example, to check the balance of someone's account, you can use the key "$.balances\[0].amount" which will pull out balances\[0].amount from the JSON response and compare it against the "value" field according to the "comparator".  The "key" is used when the return value is an array or object which contains multiple values and should be the name of the returned value or a JSONPath item.  You must always pass "key" when using "returnValueTest", even if you pass an empty string for it, because the rpc call only returns a single value.
